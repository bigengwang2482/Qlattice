Algorithm of the random number generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The state of the generator is effectively composed of the history of the generator encoded as a string.

To generate random numbers, one computes the SHA-256 hash of the string.  The hash result is viewed as a `8` 32-bit unsigned integers.

The `8` 32-bit unsigned integers are merged into `4` 64-bit unsigned integers. These `4` numbers are treated as the random numbers generated by this random number generator.

Relevant source files: `qlat-utils/include/qlat-utils/rng-state.h` and `qlat-utils/lib/rng-state.cpp`
