# Qlattice

A simple lattice QCD library.

## Installation:

The library itself is only composed of header files located in the `qlat` directory.

The major dependencies can be downloaded with

`$ ./scripts/download.sh`

These dependencies will be downloaded to the `distfiles` directory.

There are other scripts in the `scripts` directory used to install the dependencies.

The `build.sh` will install everything into the `$prefix` directory by running all the scripts in the `scripts` directory. For example, the following command will install everything into `DEST_DIRECTORY`.

`$ prefix=DEST_DIRECTORY ./build.sh`

If `$prefix` is not set, the default value in `setenv.sh` is used, which is `$HOME/qlat-build/default`.

## Usage:

A sample `Makefile` is provided which can compile and run a simple program using the library. The `Makefile` assumes that the library and all its dependencies are installed in their default locations.

There are also example programs provided in the examples directory. Once the library is completed installed, one can run the following command to compile all the examples:

`$ make -C examples run`

## Structure

```c++
const int DIMN = 4;
struct Coordinate : public array<int, DIMN> {};
```

### GeometryNode

```c++
struct GeometryNode {
  bool initialized;
  int num_node;
  int id_node;
  Coordinate size_node;
  Coordinate coor_node;
};
```

### Geometry

```c++
struct Geometry {
  bool initialized;
  GeometryNode geon;
  int eo;  // 0:full; 1:odd; 2:even
  int multiplicity;
  Coordinate node_site;
  Coordinate expansion_left;
  Coordinate expansion_right;
  Coordinate node_site_expanded;
};
```

### Field

```c++
template <class M>
struct Field {
  bool initialized;
  box<Geometry> geo;
  vector<M> field;
};
```

### FieldM

```c++
template <class M, int multiplicity>
struct FieldM : Field<M> {};
```

## Random number generator description:

The state of the generator is effectively composed of the history of the generator encoded as a string.

To generate random numbers, one computes the SHA-256 hash of the string.  The hash result is viewed as a `8` 32-bit unsigned integers.

The `8` 32-bit unsigned integers are merged into `4` 64-bit unsigned integers. These `4` numbers are treated as the random numbers generated by this random number generator.

Relevant source files: `qutils/rng-state.h`.

Relevant examples: `examples/rng-state-tests`, `examples/field-rng-tests`.

### Signal handling

Call `install_qhandle_sig()` to use handle `SIGTERM` (from `kill` command) and `SIGINT` (from `Ctrl-C`).

- `SIGTERM`: show current information and increase counter `is_sigterm_received()`. Force quit when the counter is larger than `10`.
- `SIGINT`: show current information and pause of `1` second.

### Environment variables

- `q_end_time`

  Program finish time in seconds since epoch.

  Used when `check_time_limit()`.

  Default is empty.

  `q_time_limit`

  Total running time of program in seconds.

  Used when `check_time_limit()`.

  Default is empty.

- `q_budget`

  Default budget time in seconds.

  Used when `check_time_limit()`.

  Default is `15*60`.

- `q_field_init`

  Control how field objects' data are initialized.

  Choices are `fast` (default), `zero`, `random`.

- `q_mem_cache_max_size`

  Memory cache size in MB (per processes) for `qlat::vector` allocation.

  Default is `512 MB`.

- `q_num_threads`

  Number of OpenMP threads (will be override by `OMP_NUM_THREADS`).

  Default is `2`.

- `q_acc_num_threads`

  Number of `qacc` threads.

  Default is `32`.

- `q_timer_mini_auto_display`

  Minimum time between auto-display of timer information summary.

  Default is `5.0 * 60.0`.

- `q_timer_mini_auto_show`

  Minimum run time for a function for its information to be shown when it start or stop.

  Default is `1.0`.

- `q_timer_max_always_show`

  Maximum number of times to always show function start or stop.

  Default is `10`.

- `q_timer_max_func_name_len`

  Maximum length for a function name before truncation.

  Default is `50`.
